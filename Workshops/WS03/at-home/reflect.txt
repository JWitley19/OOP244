Reflection #3

1.
There are two elements in each of the C-style character strings that stores a family
or given name for the account. The reason for this is because max_name_length has a value of 
40 characters which represents the number of characters for any name of the account holder.
The secound element is the null byte ('\0'), which is entered after.

2.
The feature that allows two functions to have the same name is called Function Overloading.

3.
I learned how to create a class with private members, instantiate an object of class type,
how to access data within an object of class type through public member functions, how to 
use standard library facilities to format data inserted into the output stream.
