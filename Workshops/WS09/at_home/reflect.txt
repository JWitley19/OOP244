At Home Workshop 9 Reflection

1. What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.

I get an error when I try to compile. The compiler doesn't see readRow() and the design().
This happens at compile time because the compiler needs to see the template code and the function code.

2. Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you need to define the template function above main(), before it is used, or can you define it below main()?

In both cases, the max() function was not found.

3. Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your functions in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments? What is the advantage of using templates?

Yes, because the functions could've been implemented. But that breaks the rule of not repeating yourself or Polymorphism.

The templates allow for cleaner code and dynamic parameter interpretation. By being able to accept the T variable. The code will be cleaner, and can be used by multiple types and different types.

4. Are the following equivalent? 
template<class T>
template<typename T>

They are equivalent in the sense that they still accomplish in making the code after it into either a template class or a template function.
