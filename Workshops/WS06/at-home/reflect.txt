Workshop 6 At Home Reflection

1. The copy assignment operator checks for self-assignment before doing anything else
because the operator receives an unmodifiable reference to a Contact object, so the copy
of that object returns a reference to  the current objected, as updated.

2. I avoided duplication by adding a temporary object in the overload += operator. This 
temporary object receives a new phone number as its parameter. Anf=d validates the number 
received. If the number is valid, the number array is resized to hold all of the existing 
numbers plus the received one, and adds the new number to the array. If the number is not 
valid, this operator will have the original array and does not add the new number. Either
way, this overload += operator returns a reference to he current object.

3.I learned how to define a copy consructor and define an assignment operator.
