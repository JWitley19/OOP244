Workshop 4 At Home Reflection

1. A safe emty state is initializing an object's instance variables in a 
constructor ensures that the object has a well-defined state from the time of its creation.

2. I minimized code duplication by creating a constructor with 5 parameters, which validates the
parameters before accepting them. And storing the object's instance variables only if the data
received is valid.

3. The canTravelWith() member function can access the private data of the object because it is 
calling object's and validating them with the bool match().

4. The statement you need is the maximum number of characters to be copied from the source.

5. I learned how to make a constructor with 5 parameters that receives the passenger's
name, destination, the year, month, and day of their departure. How to store the data
in the object's instance variables only if all of the data received is valid.
