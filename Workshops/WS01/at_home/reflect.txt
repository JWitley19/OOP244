1. What is namespace?

A namespace is a scope for the entities it encloses. Scoping rules avoid identifier conflicts across different namespaces.

2. Why are header files needed?

Header files are needed to define the function prototypes that were declared in their corresponding .cpp files.

3. In the instructions above, you were directed to compile only .cpp files but not the .h files. 
Explain why you should never compile header files.

The header files are included in the implementation files, so it is already being compiled with implementation file it is in.

4. Explain why you should never include .cpp files in another file.

You should never include a .cpp file in another file because the .cpp file is linked to the main.cpp file already. 
Also, you will get errors that the function prototypes are undefined, and any other errors in that area.

5. Explain in your own words what have you learned on this workshop.

I learned how to properly use a namespace, and how to use a safeguard.
