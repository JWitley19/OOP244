WS 7 Reflection

1. The Hero class does not need to know about the of the SuperHero class, because the SupperHero
class is not of use in the Hero implementation file. The word "SuperHero" does not appear
anywhere.

2. The SuperHero class needs to know sbout the existence of the Hero class, because the Hero class 
is the derived class in this case and SuperHero is the base class. The word "Hero" does appear
anywhere.

3. It printed out "Ancient Battle!". I think it printed that out because the hero or superhero who is
mentioned first, is what class they belong to. so if Wonder Woman was mentioned first, I think it would
have printed out "Super Fight!".

4. True, they would be valid expressions. The moment that the constructor is called (Only if the parameters are valid), the objects are created.

5. True, they would be valid expressions. Same as the above answer. But the only thing that would be different, is the fact that the heroes were not saved in a variable.
