Workshop #2 Reflection

1. You need to allocate new dynamic memory when you increase the size
of an existing array of dynamincally allocated memory because when you increase
the size of the array there needs to be more memory. Which the existing array of dynamically
allocated memory doesn't have.

2. We don't need to use the delete operator on the array itself because the 
delete operator can only work on pointers not the array itself.

3. The compiler knows which definition to call based off of the parameters 
that are set in the function.

4. I learned how to allocate and deallocate memory.
